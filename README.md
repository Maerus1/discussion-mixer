# discussion-mixer
A re-imagined online discussion forum using the Laravel framework

## Getting started

In the project directory run "composer install". Make a copy of the
.env.example file and rename the copy .env then fill in the fields
according to your configuration.

After that, just to make sure everything is good, run "php artisan key:generate"

Then you can run "php artisan migrate" if you need to set up the
database then "php artisan serve" to run! Have fun!
